# Backbase-Mobile-Assignment

## Simple Swift application for filtering cities from a large JSON file. Each city contains the following information:

```
{
    "country":"UA",
    "name":"Hurzuf",
    "_id":707860,
    "coord":{
        "lon":34.283333,
        "lat":44.549999
    }
}
```

## Usage
- Use the SearchBar to filter cities
- Tapping on a city will show the location on a map

## Notes
- Built In ~3 Hours
- Supports Light & Dark Mode
- Given more time for this task I would look at improving the UI and may have used MVVM architecture
- XCTests included
